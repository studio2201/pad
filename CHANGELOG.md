## [1.0.20] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- **RFC Compliance**: Updated `shared-assets` to `v3.0.32` to inherit standard RFC 7235 compliance (`WWW-Authenticate` headers for unauthorized responses).

## [1.0.18] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **Collision & Race Protection**:
  1. Replaced weak millisecond-timestamp-based notepad IDs with cryptographically secure random 32-character hex tokens to prevent collisions.
  2. Synchronized all notepad crud operations (create, rename, delete) under a thread-safe mutex lock (`notepads_lock`) to prevent concurrent updates from corrupting `notepads.json`.

## [1.0.17] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
